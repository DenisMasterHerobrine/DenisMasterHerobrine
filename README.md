😄 Hello, I'm just a programming enthusiast that likes solving some difficult tasks and create uncommon solutions.

🧊 Previously was an active Minecraft modder and modpack developer, there are some repositories around Minecraft modding here and there with more than 25 millions of downloads overall.

🌍 I'm currently practicing in Java and enterprise frameworks to move on from gaming to something serious development. I love learning stuff and solving tasks that I previously wasn't able to solve.

🌑 I like doing space-related projects from time to time and I wish to step on Mars at least one time in this life. Sounds a bit crazy, right? That's why 

🐲 Love playing with VR, AI and something related to space.
